# Field Service Management App â€“ Power Platform (Plan Designer Demo)

This repository showcases a fully structured Field Service Management (FSM) solution scaffolded using Microsoft's **Power Platform Plan Designer** and enhanced by the team at [HarjTech](https://www.harjtech.com). The appâ€™s backend was generated using a natural language prompt, and then architected into a production-ready structure designed for extensibility, performance, and real-world field use.

## What This Repository Includes

- **Dataverse Tables** for:
  - Jobs
  - Clients
  - Invoices
  - Materials
  - Technicians
- **Predefined Relationships** between tables
- Prompt-driven design built with **Power Platform Plan Designer**
- Architecture built for **Canvas App development** with Collections
- Extensible for:
  - Power Automate (Flows)
  - Power Pages (Customer Portal)
  - Copilot Studio Agents
  - Responsive UI on desktop/tablet

---

## ðŸ› How This Was Built

1. A detailed FSM scenario was described in natural language and submitted to **Plan Designer**.
2. Plan Designer created a complete backend: Dataverse entities, schema, and relationships.
3. The HarjTech team reviewed, validated, and extended the structure to ensure:
   - Offline-capable collections
   - Optimized for scheduling, job tracking, and quoting
   - Integration-readiness (Teams, SharePoint, Azure Logic Apps)
   - Clean extensibility for real use cases

---

## Business Problems It Solves

- Field technicians lack a unified scheduling tool  
- Dispatchers rely on spreadsheets with no central CRM  
- Invoicing is delayed or manually tracked  
- Clients canâ€™t track job status or history  

This solution fixes those gaps by creating a real-time, mobile-ready, unified job tracking system â€” backed by Microsoft Dataverse and extendable using the full Power Platform.

## Why Use Plan Designer?

Plan Designer helps you skip weeks of data modeling by turning a business prompt into a structured backend. But the real magic happens after that â€” when experts like **HarjTech** convert that base into real working apps, integrations, governance rules, and usable UI.

- **Security:** Only accessible with System Admin or System Customizer role  
- **Enterprise Ready:** Use in DEV or PROD; built for full ALM integration  
- **Speed:** From idea to backend in <5 minutes  
- **Copilot Integration:** Includes Copilot agents for interaction
